                    <p>Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (/ˈrɛmbrænt, ˈrɛmbrɑːnt/,[2] Dutch: [ˈrɛmbrɑnt ˈɦɑrmə(n)ˌsoːɱ vɑn ˈrɛin] (listen); 15 July 1606[1] – 4 October 1669), usually simply known as Rembrandt, was a Dutch Golden Age painter, printmaker and draughtsman. An innovative and prolific master in three media,[3] he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history.[4] It is estimated Rembrandt produced a total of about three hundred paintings, three hundred etchings and two thousand drawings.</p>
                    <p>Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of styles and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological themes and animal studies. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), whilst antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was prolific and innovative. This era gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as Jan Vermeer, Rembrandt was an avid art collector and dealer.</p>

                <p>Rembrandt [11] Harmenszon ("son of Harmens") van Rijn was born on July 15, 1606 (according to some sources, in 1607) in the large family of a wealthy mill owner Harmen Gerritszon van Rijn in Leiden . According to Dutch researchers, the mother's family remained in the bosom of the Catholic Church, although after the Dutch Revolution Protestantism dominated the country . [12]</p>
                <p>From the age of four, young Rembrandt attended the prestigious Latin school at Leiden University , where he showed the greatest interest in painting. At the age of 13, he was given to study fine arts with the Leiden historical painter Jacob van Swanenburch , a Catholic by faith. Researchers have not discovered Rembrandt's works of this period, and the question of Swanenburgh's influence on the formation of his creative style remains open: too little is known today about this artist.</p>
                <p>In 1623, Rembrandt continued his art studies in Amsterdam with the master of historical painting Peter Lastman , who completed an internship in Italy and specialized in historical, mythological and biblical subjects [12] (one of Peter Lastman's paintings was in the collection of the Ukrainian art critic Vasyl Shchavynskyi , now it is in Hermitage ).</p>
                <p>In 1627, Rembrandt returned to his hometown and, together with his friend Jan Livens, set up his own studio on the roof of his parents' house in Leiden. Later, the workshop gained considerable popularity.</p>

            <div className='content'>
                <p>Rembrandt took up the development of biblical subjects, paints the first portraits, there is even one seascape ("Concert" 1626, " St. Stephen is stoned" 1629, "Christ in Emmaus" , "Seascape" 1630, "Self-portrait at the easel" 1628 ). Rembrandt was noticed by wealthy patrons. Konstantin Huygens , then the secretary of the Prince of Orange , made the young artist an order for paintings for his master. At this stage, Rembrandt independently began to study the works of art of the Baroque era , and was also fascinated by the work of the Flemish painter Rubens .</p>

                <p>In 1631, Rembrandt left the workshop in Leiden and moved to Amsterdam. A year later, Jan Lievens closed the workshop and went to England to earn a living. The friends went their separate ways.</p>
                <p>In Amsterdam, Rembrandt created many portraits. Religious subjects are present in the works of that time ("Prophet Jeremiah" 1630, Rijksmuseum ). Rembrandt painted two paintings of a religious subject by order of the Stadthalter Frederik Hendrick of Orange ("The Exaltation of the Cross", "The Removal of Christ from the Cross"). In the works, the influence of the Baroque engravings of Peter Paul Rubens is felt.</p>
                <p>The group portrait "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulip" (1632) brought success to the artist.</p>
                <p>In 1634, Rembrandt married Saskia van Eilenburch , the daughter of the burgomaster of Leeuwarden . Thanks to a successful marriage, the artist entered the circle of wealthy people. Now Rembrandt barely had time to paint portraits. A lot of money appeared, so he bought a house in Amsterdam. There he set up a workshop and began to collect works of art (engravings, paintings by foreign masters, weapons, musical instruments, rare clothes and exotic overseas items). Several of his masterpieces appeared during this period ( "Self-portrait with Saskia on her knees" , 1636).</p>
                <p>The large canvas "Night Watch" is now considered a masterpiece . But in the year of its appearance, the picture caused a scandal. After all, 16 officers contributed 100 guilders each for the right to be equal among equals and a little more equal than others. Usually, shooters were painted at a banquet. Rembrandt presented them as a guard going on a campaign.</p>
                <p>In 1640, Rembrandt's mother Cornelia died. Three children of Rembrandt and Saskia died in childhood. In 1641, a son, Titus, was born . A year later, Saskia died.</p>
                <p>Some time after the death of his wife, Rembrandt's affair with his mistress Hertier Dirks created a lot of noise. The matter reached the court and a new scandal. The artist was prevented from remarrying by the will of his first wife, which forbade her husband to use her property if a second marriage took place. This became an obstacle for the marriage with the 20-year-old maid Hendrikje Stoffels .</p>
                <p>During the novel, the artist created many portraits of his mistress, which became the pinnacle of the artist's works ("Hendriquier", 1654, Louvre, Paris; "Hendriquier Enters the Water", 1654, London, National Gallery; "Bathing of Bathsheba" 1654 , Louvre ). "Portrait of Hendrikje near the window" ( Berlin ) is placed on a par with the best portraits in the world .</p>
                <p>Hendrikye gave birth to the artist's daughter Cornelia and lived with him for 10 years.</p>
